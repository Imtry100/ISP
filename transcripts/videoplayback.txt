There are questions you're going to get in your next interview and in every interview you do forever moving forward. I've been in recruitment for 15 years and in today's video I'm going to give you five mock interview questions that you need to practice and get right before your next interview. Let's go. Now the first one you need to understand is tell me about yourself. This is a question you're going to get in just about every single interview and the reason why is it's an easy way to start the interview.
It's a great way to get the candidate talking, learn a little bit more, and form your early opinion on how the candidate communicates and how ready they are for the interview. Now as a candidate, this isn't a life story, right? This isn't you going back and telling them about
you know the first time you know you rode a bike right this is basically a quick opportunity for you early in the interview to articulate how your career has been building to this moment and why you are a great fit for the job this whole interview question is about you being able to say
here's what I've done bam bam bam and here's why that has positioned me to be a great candidate for the job. So you might want to start with your education if it's aligned quickly move through some of the early roles that have positioned you for this role as you get closer if you want to talk about any great stories you have
briefly in terms of things you've accomplished in recent roles, that's great. And then end why all of those things has positioned you to be a great candidate. That sounds like a lot, but you want to be efficient when you communicate this. This really should be no more than a minute to a minute and a half.
if you find yourself talking three and a half minutes in still explaining tell me about yourself you haven't done it right now we've arrived at the first trap question here and that's why are you looking to leave your job if you are already uh working like if you're working right now and if you're leaving a job to come here they're gonna want to know like why are you interested in leaving right and what they're looking for here is red flags i hate my boss
I don't like the company I'm at. I don't like the team culture. Negativity. Negativity is what people are looking for. You need to make sure you do not give it to them. If you give it to them, you will be discarded. It will likely be the end of your candidacy with this organization. The key to answering this interview question is make it about what you are moving towards, not what you are moving from.
So, talk about how you're really happy in your current role, but there's something that you're not able to do, and you're focused on an opportunity that will allow you to do that. That's basically the gist of it. It might sound something like this. You know, that's a really great question, and to be honest, I'm pretty happy where I'm at currently. I have a great team. My boss is great. However, in my current role, I don't get to do as much A, B, and C as I'd like to.
That's one of the things that I found really intriguing about this opportunity. When I found the job description online, it looks like that's a big part of what this person's going to be doing on a day-to-day basis, and I see that as what's next for me in my career is spending more time doing A, B, and C. So that's why I'm here. What that does is it aligns you with the role while also retaining leverage because you're not saying, I need to get out of this opportunity or I dislike where I'm at currently.
That's how you answer it. Another question you're going to get is why should we hire you? And what this question actually means is why should we hire you instead of somebody else? So the perfect way to answer this question is to briefly talk about how you're qualified, what you've done in previous roles to succeed that's similar to this role. And then if you have what I call an unfair advantage, something you have in your background that most people will not have,
who are interviewing for this role that makes you a great candidate, you want to share this here. Maybe it's that you've been in multiple different industries and that perspective that you will have makes you unique and valuable coming into this role. Maybe it's that you have a higher level of education or certifications. Maybe it's that you speak an additional language and that's something you could use in this role. Whatever it is, try to find something that you have in your background that most people who are going to be interviewing, competing against you for this role will not have. That's how you answer it.
The next question they're going to ask you is, why do you want to work here? They're trying to gauge your interest, preparation, and passion. The best way to answer this question is using the 50-50 rule. The 50-50 rule states the first 50% of your answer needs to be about why the organization is specifically intriguing to you. I've actually made a ton of these videos for a ton of companies that I've profiled. So if you want to get specific examples, feel free to watch any one of those. And the second 50%, that's why the role is a really good fit for you right now in your career.
And if you can do those two things and you balance it you will do great. That's how you answer this question perfectly Why is the company attractive? Why is a role a good fit do both those things? You're gonna nail this question now the next thing that you need to answer is what are you looking for salary wise?
Salary is going to get brought up in just about every interview process you have and answering it correctly could be the difference between You know getting a great salary or getting lowballed and it starts with more than just this question So I actually made this video here to take you through everything you need to know salary wise so I'm done here But I'll see you over there
