  "answer": "\n    Hi, my name is Satyam. I'm a final year B.Tech student in Computer Science. \n    I've been really passionate about software development since I was in high school. \n    I started with simple Python projects and gradually moved to web development and machine learning.\n    \n    What motivates me is the ability to solve real-world problems through technology. \n    I recently worked on a project that helped automate attendance tracking using face recognition,\n    and seeing it actually work in our college was incredibly satisfying.\n    \n    I'm looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills in a challenging environment\n    and continue to learn and grow as a developer.\n    ",
